# Spooky Night
like the prologue of omori but worse 
# Genre(s)
horror, thriller, puzzle
# Target audience
teens and young adults
# Player Experience and Game POV
a kid waking up late at night, it is top down view, similar to undertale/omori. player should feel stressed and scared at some points. player should be engaged by the reward of solving the story
# Visual and Audio Style
simple visuals, retro-er side of things. pixelated. like undertale/omori. lack of audio for a lot of it, when there is audio it is omminous. 
concept art or reference art can you show to give the feel of the game?
# Game World Fiction
it all plays out within a house. the setting is supposed to be realistic, but from the mind of a spooked child, so things are exaggerated for the protagonist. such as a long hallway seeming infinite, or stairs seeming infinite.
# Core Loops
players explore and find puzzles that when solved open more areas to explore, where there are more puzzles and so on. like in games like mad father and ib
# Objectives and Progression
player moves with wasd or arrow keys. walk through the house. short term goals are solving puzzles/riddles where answers are made clear by interacting with objects throughout the house. long term goal is to be able to go back to sleep.
# Game Systems
What systems are needed to make this game? Which ones are internal (simulation, etc.) and which does the
player interact with?
# Interactivity
How are different kinds of interactivity used? (Action/Feedback, ST Cog, LT Cog, Emotional, Social, Cultural)
What is the player doing moment-by-moment? How does the player move through the world? How does
physics/combat/etc. work? A clear, professional-looking sketch of the primary game UX is helpful.
